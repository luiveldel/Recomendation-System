# Recommendation system

The aim of this project is to work on a recommendation system. 

I am going to apply statistical and machine learning methods to construct our own recommenders and evaluate which recommender performe the best.

## Examples of Recommendation Engines
* Product recommentation: Amazon
* Movie recommentation: Netflix
* Music recommentation: Spotify
* Social recommentation: Facebook

## Data Sources
Datasets are extracted from: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Restaurant+%26+consumer+data

The dataset was obtained from a recommender system prototype. The task was to generate a top-n list of restaurants according to the consumer preferences.
